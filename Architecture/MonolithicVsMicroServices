When developing a server-side application you can start it with a modular hexagonal or layered architecture
which consists of different types of components:

Presentation — responsible for handling HTTP requests and responding with either HTML or JSON/XML (for web services APIs).
Business logic — the application’s business logic.
Database access — data access objects responsible for access the database.
Application integration — integration with other services (e.g. via messaging or REST API).

Benefits of Monolithic Architecture :

1. Simple to develop
2. Simple to Test (Simply can do e2e testing just by launching an application)
3. Simple to deploy
4. Simple to scale horizontally by running multiple copies behind load balancer 

Notes :In the early stages of the project it works well and basically most of the big and successful applications 
which exist today were started as a monolith.

Drawbacks of Monolithic Architecture :

1. Application would be too large and complex to fully understand and made changes fast and correctly .
2. The size of the application can slow down the startup time.
3. Redeploy entire application for each update 
4. Impact of a change is usually not very well understood which leads to extensive manual testing.
5. Continuous deployment is difficult.
6. Monolithic application can also be difficult to scale when different modules have conflicting resource requirement .
7. Bug (Memory Leak ) in any module can bring down the entire process application .
8. Monolithic application has a barrier to addopt new technologies ,Since the changes in framework or language can affect 
   entire application ,it is extremely expensive in both time and cost
